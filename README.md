# CompassPartout
This amazing Android application shows you where the North is. And if you're smart enough, you should be able to deduce the following directions:
* The South
* The East
* The West

## Additional features
If you're lost in a wild forest, this app gives your GPS position with an amazing precision (between 1 nanometer to 100 meters). The information given is :
* Latitude in degrees
* Longitudes in degrees

## Screenshots
No screenshots, it's too complicated. I don't have the dexterity to press two buttons at the same time.

*Why not use the Android Emulator to take the screenshot ?* 
Good idea. But you know how lazy I am.


## Frequently Asked Questions 
### The application is not showing the north, what's happening ? 
You are not on planet Earth, or you leave near a giant magnet. Check you surroundings for giant magnets and then go away from it.
### My GPS position is incorect, why ?
*Possibility 1* : The satellites may have been took down by Chineese long-range missiles, it's the begining of WWIII. You should run for you're life.

*Possibility 2* : You live in a cave. Go out to see the sun.
### My screen is black, I don't understand
You're out of battery. Please charge your phone. 
### I don't understand how to use it
Seriously ? There are *NO BUTTONS*, you just have to click on the app icon to make it work
### Why would I use this ?
Isn't it obvious ? It shows you *THE NORTH*, so this app is obviously for people who want to visit the north pole and take some selfies with polar bears.
